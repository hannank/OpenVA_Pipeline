OpenVA_Pipeline 
===============

The `OpenVA Pipeline <https://github.com/D4H-CRVS/OpenVA_Pipeline>`_ automates the processing of verbal autopsy (VA) data from an
`ODK Aggregate server <https://docs.opendatakit.org/aggregate-intro/>`_, through the
`openVA <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/openVA/index.html>`_ library from the `R <https://cran.r-project.org/>`_ statistical
software, and ending with a DHIS2 server (with the `VA program <https://github.com/SwissTPH/dhis2_va_draft>`_).  A friendly graphical
user interface to R is also provided via an `RShiny app <https://github.com/D4H-CRVS/OpenVA_RShiny>`_ and
`vignette <https://github.com/D4H-CRVS/OpenVA_RShiny/blob/master/shiny-openVA-vignette.pdf>`_.
